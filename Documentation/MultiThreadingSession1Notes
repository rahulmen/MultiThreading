Multitasking means performing different tasks  simultaneously.

There are two types of Multitasking.
a. Process based Multitasking
b. Thread Based Multitasking


A. PROCESS BASED MULTITASKING

This multitasking is performed at OS level and if we have different task and all task are independent and can be performed simultaneously.
Example :- Coding on PC and Listening to Music.

B. THREAD BASED MULTITASKING

When we have single program with 10k line of code and Java Interperter executs complete code line by line which take 10 hrs.
If we can divide our complete code into many independent code so that each different thread and execute our line of code which will reduce our execution time.

In thread based multitasking is performed at Program level and is more client specific.It can not be performed at System Level.

MULTITHREADING
===================


MULTITHREADING is a concept where we can execute our each bunch of independent code with different Thread so that our execution time will be reduced drastically.

Practical Example :- Seaching Particular String in all Files present in our PC.

Instead of searching each in each file one by one. For each folder we can define different thread and perform this task in very less time.
