sleep() Method:-

If any Thread want to pause its execution for defined time then we should use Thread.sleep() method.

Type of Thread Methods :-

1. public static void sleep(long Mills)

This is a static method as we are able to access this method directly from Class Name.

2. public static void sleep(long mills,int nano)

Exception Throws :- Interrupted Exception

Once we have call .sleep() method on any Thread there may be chance of causing Interrupted Exception.
So if we have called .sleep() method then either we have to Surround it using try-catch or using throws Keyword to throw InterruptedException.

Once we have called .sleep() method on any Thread after defined amount of time Thread scheduler will not directly assign processor to that thread.
That thread will be moved to Runnable state and then thread scheduler will pick thread as per the priority.
