yield() method

public static void yield()
====================

We can use yield() method on any thread to halt execution of that thread so that Thread executer will assign processor to waiting thread of Same Priority.

Note :- Once we have applied yield() method on any thread object that thread will be move to waiting list where many other thread of same priority is waiting and its Thread executor responsibility
to pick any Thread from waiting list and assigned processor to it for execution.

Practically we use yield method on threads which might take many hours to complete its run() method. Benefit is other waiting thread which can take only nanoseconds to complete should complete its execution.

Once any Thread will call the yield method we cannot determine when again this thread will get Processor to execute.

join() method
================

If any thread has dependency on any other thread then that thread should use join() method to wait until dependent thread should complete and its result output waiting thread should use and 
continue its execution.

Thread1(t1)         Thread2(t2)
				     t2.join();
				     
If thread2 is waiting for thread1 then we should call join() method on thread2 object.

THREAD LIFE CYCLE IN CASE OF JOIN().


MyThreat t = new MyThread();	t.start()					if thread scheduler assigned processor							if t.run() completed
							================				============================================				========================
Thread State --- New/Born					Runnable() state											Running() state							DEAD STATE

																								If in Running state thread call .join() method
																								then it will moved into waiting state until that thread on which .join()
																								method is called got complete.
																								And Again Thread have to wait for thread scheduler to assign processer to it.
																								SO Once .join() method is called thread will move to step 2
																								
There are 3 .join() method :-

1. public final void join();
2. public final void join(long time);
3. public final void join(long ms,int ns)	
																								
Method is final so that Child class can not override this method.
