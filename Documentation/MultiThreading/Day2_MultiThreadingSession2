LIFE CYCLE OF THREAD

MyThread t = new MyThread()---thread start/born------t.start------thread is Runnable-----this thread pick by Thread Scheduler----t.run() executed thread Running---------t.run() complete----thread dead

=====================================

There are basically two ways to define thread.

1. By extending Thread Class
2. By Implementing Runnable Interface

NOTE:--
The second approach is more good because if our MyThread class already extend Thread class than it can not extend any other class so we will miss inheritance property.
But in second approach we cant loose Inheritance Benefit.

DIFFERENCE B/W START() METHOD AND RUN() METHOD
===============================================

Thread t = new Thread();
t.start();

This method is used to start the thread and once thread scheduler will be pick this thread automatically overrided run() method will be executed.

Thread t = new Thread();
t.run();

In this case new Thread is created but not yet started so run() method will be executed like a normal method by main thread.
