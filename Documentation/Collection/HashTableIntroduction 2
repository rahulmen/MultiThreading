Constructor of HashTable:-

1. HashTable m = new HashTable();

Created HashTable with default initial capacity 11.

2. HashTable m = new HashTable(int intialCapacity);

Created HashTable with providied initialCapacity.

3. HashTable m = new HashTable(int initialCap,float floatratio);

4. HashTable m = new HashTable(Map m);

NOTE :- In HashTable element are added on basis of hashCode of Keys
