MAP
====

1. Map is not child interface of collection.
2. Unlike Collection in Map we store Objects in form of key-Value pair.
3. Single pair of key-Value is called Entry.

Common Function of Map:-

1. Object put(Object key,Object value);
If for corresponding Key if value is already present then it will replace the value and will return old value Object.
2. void putAll(Map m);
3. boolean containsKey(Object o);
4. boolean containsValue(Object 0);
5. boolean isEmpty();
6. int size();


ENTRY
=====

Without Map there is no chance of Entry as Entry exist within Map. So Entry(I) is inner Interface of Map Interface.

interface Map{
interface Entry{
//There are three Entry Specific Methods.
 Object getKey();
 Object getValue();
 void setValue();
}}

Some More Methods:-
1. Set keySet();
Method to get only Key from a Map as Key don't have duplicate so return type is Set.

2. Collection Values();
Method to get Values from a Map as Map can contain duplicate so return type is Collection.

3. Set entrySet();
Method to get individual entry from Map.
