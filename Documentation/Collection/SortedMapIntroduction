SORTEDMAP
============

1. SortedMap is the child interface of Map Interface.
2. Implementation class for SortedMap interface is TreeMap.
3. In SortedMap object are stored according to sorting order of Keys.
4. We can store both homogenous and hetrogenous object in values and in Keys we can store homogenous objects only if we are dependent on default natural sorting order.
(We will get Class caste Exception if we will try to store hetrogenous Object in keys )
5. If we have our own sorting order then we can even store hetrogenous object in keys.
6. Null acceptance is not possible in Keys if we will store NULL in key then we will get NullPointerException but we can store NULL in values.

SortedMap method:-
Note :- All method are abstract.

1. Object firstKey();
2. Object lastKey();
3. SortedMap tailMap();
4. SortedMap headMap();
5. SortedMap subMap();
6. Comparator comparator();


TREEMAP
========

1. It is a Implementation class of SortedMap Interface.
2. In this class Insertion Order is based on the Sorting order we are using  either default or user defined.
3. Null is not allowed in Key but allowed in value.

Constructor
-----------

TreeMap m = new TreeMap();
Element are added based on default natural Sorting Order.

TreeMap m = new TreeMap(Map m);
Create Equivalent TreeMap for Map passed.

TreeMap m = new TreeMap(Comparator c)
Element are added based on customized Sorting.

TreeMap m = new TreeMap(SortedMap m);
Create equivalent TreeMap for Provided SortedMap.
