Regular Expression :-

1. If we want to represent group of string according to a particular pattern then we should go for regular expressions.

Example1 :-
We can write a regular expression to represent all valid mobile number and mailIds.

The main important application area of regular expression are 
1. To develop validation frameworks.
2. To develop pattern matching applications(Control f in windows, grep in unix)
3. To develop translator like compiler and interpreters etc.
4. To develop digital circuits.
5. To develop communication protocols like TCP/IP,UDP etc.

Pattern:-
A pattern object is a compiled version of regular expression that it is a java equivalent Object of pattern.
We can create a pattern object by using compiled method of pattern class.

public static Pattern compile(String regEx);

eg:-
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("ab");

Matcher :-
We can use matcher Object to check the given pattern in the target String.
We can create a matcher Object by using matcher method of Pattern Class.

public Matcher matcher(String target);

eg :-
Matcher m = p.matcher("abbaba");

Important Methods of matcher Class.
1. boolean find();
It attempts to find the next match and returns true if it is avalaible.

2. int start();
Returns start index of the match

3. int end();
Returns end+1 index of the match

4. int group();

Return the match pattern.

Note :- Pattern and Matcher Classes present in java.util.regex package and introduced in 1.4v.
