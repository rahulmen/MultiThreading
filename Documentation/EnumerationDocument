Enumeration provide the purpose to declare group of named constraints in Programming Language.
For example the 4 suits in a deck of playing cards may be 4 enumerators named Club, Diamond, 
Heart, and Spade, belonging to an enumerated type named Suit. 

enum Suit{

Club,Diamond,Heart,Spade;

}
========================================

enum Color 
    { 
        RED, GREEN, BLUE; 
    }

Internally above enum will be converted into 

class Color{

public static final Color RED = new Color();
public static final Color GREEN = new Color();
public static final Color BLUE = new Color();

}

=============================================

Importamt Point :-

1. enum in java implicitly extends java.lang.Enum so it can not extend any other class in java but can implement many interface.
2. toString() method is overridden in java.lang.Enum class to return enum constraint name. 

=========================================

Methods avalaible in java.lang.Enum

values();
This method is used to return all element present inside enum.

ordinal();
Using this method each enum constrant index can be found,Just like array Index.

valueOf(String str);
This method can be used to get particular enum constraints.

=====================================

enum and constructor :

1.enum can contain constructor and it is executed separately for each enum constant at the time of enum class loading.
2. We can’t create enum objects explicitly and hence we can’t invoke enum constructor directly.
3. enum can only contains complete method so that means no concreate method.
