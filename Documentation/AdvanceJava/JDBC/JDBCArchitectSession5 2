JDBC ARCHITECT :-
==================

													Java Application

														JDBC API
															|
															|
														Driver Manager

							Oracle DB						MySQL DB									Sybage DB
							
1. JDBC API Driver Manager to JavaApplication.
2. Java Application can communicate with any DataBAse with the help of Driver Manager and Driver Software.


Driver Manager:-
===============

1. It is the Key Component of JDBC.
2. It is a class present in java.sql package.
3. It is responsible to manage all DataBase drivers.
4. It is responsible to register and unregister DataBase Drivers.

DriverManager.registerDriver(driver);
DriverManager.unregisterDriver(driver);

5. It is responsible to establish connection between JavaApplication and the database with the help of Driver software.

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcURL,username,password);

DataBase Driver
==============

1. Very important component of JDBC Architecture with DataBase driver we con not connect DataBase.
2. It is responsible to convert DataBase Specific call to JavaCalls and vice versa.


Question :- Why Java is platform Independent?

Answer :-


													Java Application
															|
															|
															|(After Compiling using javac)
															|
															|
														.class file(Byte Code)
															|

								|								|											|
							JVM for Windows					JVM for Linux								JVM for Mac	
								|								|											|
								|								|											|								
								|								|											|
							Window Platform					Linux Platform							   Mac Platform
							
							
							
Note :- Because of different JVM for each operating System Java is platform independent Similarly because of different Driver Software for each DataBase Java is also DataBase independent.
