JDBC DRIVER
============

Types of JDBC Driver

1. Type 1 Driver(JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver)
2. Type 2 Driver(Native API partially Java Driver or Native Driver)	
3. Type 3 Driver(All Java Net protocol Driver or Network Protocol Driver or MiddleWare Driver)
4. Type 4 Driver(Pure Java Driver or Native protocol Driver or Thin Driver)


TYPE 1 DRIVER :-
===============

Java Application(JDBC)=======Type1 Driver=======ODBC Driver======DataBase.

1.Introduced by SUN Microsystem as a part of JDK.
2.Act as a bridge between JDBC AND ODBD so called as JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver.
Java Application(JDBC),Type1 Driver,ODBC Driver all need to be avaialble on Client Machine.

Advantage :-
1. It is DataBase Dependent.
2. Easy to Use.


Disadvantage :-

1. Performance is very low because two conversion is done first from JDBC Driver call to ODBC Driver Call and then ODBC Driver call to DataBase Call.
2. No Support after Java Version 1.7
3. As ODBC Driver can only be used for Windows so it is also limited to Windows Platform.

TYPE 2 DRIVER :-
===============

Java Application(JDBC)=======Type2 Driver=======DataBase Vendor Specific Native Libraries======DataBase.

1. It is also known as Native API Partially API Driver.
2. It is exactly same as Type 1 Driver only difference is ODBC Driver is replaced by DataBase Vendor Specific Native Libraries.
3. Native libraries means a set of function written in non-Java(mostly C/C++).
4. We have to install vendor provide native libraries on Client Machine.

Advantage :-

1. When compared to Type1 Driver performance is high because Type2 Driver converts JavaCalls into Database Specific Native Libraries call which is understandable by DataBAse.
2. Portability is more. As we can use Type2 Driver on multiple difference Platform.

Disadvantage :-

1. It is Platform dependent each time we change Platform we need different Type2 Driver.
2. It is DataBase Dependent each time we change DataBase we need different Type 2 Driver.
3. Support for DataBase Vendor Specific Native Libraries is only provided by Oracle but not from mYSQL.

Note :- It is a worst JDBC Driver to use as it is both Platform and DataBase Dependent Driver.

Example of Type 2 Driver :-

1. OCI Driver(Oracle Call Driver) is Type 2 Driver provided by Oracle.
2. If We want to use OCI Driver then we want OCI Driver and OCI Libraries(.jar file) on our Client Machine and also need to set Class Path.


Java Application(JDBC)=======OCI Driver=======OCI Libraries======DataBase.

TYPE 3 DRIVER :-
===============

Java Application(JDBC)=======Type3 Driver=======MiddleWare Server(IDS Server)======DataBase.

IDS :- Internet DataBase Server

1. It is also known as Java Net protocol Driver or Network Protocol Driver or MiddleWare Driver.
2. This driver converts Java Specific calls into MiddleWare Specific calls which is then converted into DataBase Call via MiddleWare.
3. It is best choice for Industry Use.
4. Java Application(JDBC),Type3 Driver need to be on Same Machine.
5. MiddleWare uses either Type1,Type 2 or Type 4 Driver.

Advantage :-
1. Platform Independent.
2. DataBase Independent.

Disadvantage :-
1. Performance is low because it also needs two level of conversion.
2. Extra cost of Maintaining MiddleWare Server.

Note :- The only Driver which is both platform and DataBase Independent hence it is recommended to use.

TYPE 4 DRIVER :-
===============

Java Application(JDBC)=======Type4 Driver======DataBase

1. Also known as Pure Java Driver or All Java Native protocol Driver or Thin Driver.
2. This Driver uses DataBase Specific Native Protocols to communicate with DataBase.
3. This Driver directly Convert JDBC Call into DataBase Specific Calls.
4. It is platform independent Driver because it is purely developed into Java.
5. It is called Thin Driver because its don't need any ODBC Driver or Native Libraries or MiddleWare Server.

Advantage :-

1. It is Platform Independent.
2. Its Performance is very high because of SIngle COnversion only.

Disadvantage :-

1. It is DataBase Dependent.

Note :- TYpe 4 driver is provided by DataBase Vendor

Q :- Which Driver to be used in which Scenario ?
Ans :-

1.If we are only going to use single dataBase then it is best to use Type-4 Driver . It is ideal for standAlone Application and Small Scale Web Application.
2. If we are going to handle multiple DataBAse then use Type 3 because it is DataBase Dependent also. Ideal for Large/Enterprise Scale Application.

3. If Typ3 4 and 3 is not available then we can use Type 2 and if Type 2 is not avaiable then we use Type 1 .
