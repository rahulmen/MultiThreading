JDBC API(Java Application)=========Driver Software==========DataBase

1. JDBC API defines several classes and interface which can be used for DataBase Communication.
2. Programmer and DataBase Vendor are supposed to use JDBC API.
3. There are two package in JDBC API that is java.sql and javax.sql

Package java.sql :-

This package contains basic Interface and Classes like DriverManager,Connection,Statement,ResultSet.

Package javax.sql :-

This package contains advance Interface and Classes like RowSet and ConnectionPool etc and also have SubPackage like javax.sql.rowset , javax.sql.rowset.serail


4. Programmer is not responsible to provide implementation to Interface present in JDBC API. DataBaseVendor(Oracle,MySQL) is responsible

5. DataBase Driver Software(Oracle DB Driver) :- Is the set of implemented Classes(.jar file) that implement interface present in JDBC API.

6. Using this Driver Software we can communicate to DataBase.

7. Every DriverSoftware is identified by the special class that is Driver.class which is implementation class of java.sql.Driver Interface.

Example :-

Type-1 DriverSoftware provided by SUN MicroSystems as the part of JDBC Driver class is  sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver

DRIVER INTERFACE:-
==================

It is the requirement specification present in java.sql package to develop Driver Class .

DRIVER CLASS:-
==================

It is the implementation class for Driver Interface present in Driver Software

DRIVER SOFTWARE:-
==================

It is the set of implementation class for interface present in JDBC API and package java.sql package and javax.sql package
