Introduction to Advance Java
============================

With Core Java Knowledge we can only develop stand alone application which can only run on single machine like Calculator but using advance Java we can develop Web Application(Application which 
provide service over web)which multiple user across the globe can access at single time like gmail.com and facebook.com.

Three Advance Java Topic:-

1. JDBC
2. Servlets
3. JSPs

Where to use above three technology:-

1. JSP(Java Server Pages) :- Wherever we want to develop view Component(Pages end user can see) and wherever presentation login to develop.
Like LoginPage(login.jsp) HomePage(home.jsp) and ErrorPage(error.jsp) of Gmail.com application

2. Servlet :- Wherever processing logic is required we should go for Servelet.(ProcessServlet) and wherever some processing or business 
	logic is required

3. JDBC :- Sometime a java component required to communicate with DataBase.Its a technology that help Java Component to communicate with DataBase

Editors of Java:-

1. Java Standard Edition(J2SE/JSE) ----Core Java+JDBC(Used to develop Standalone Application)
2. Java Enterprise Edition(J2EE/JEE) ------Servlets+JSPs (USed to develop Web Application)
3. Java Micro Edition(J2ME/JME) -----Used to develop RemoteController,WashingMachine and MobileApplication

Version:-
