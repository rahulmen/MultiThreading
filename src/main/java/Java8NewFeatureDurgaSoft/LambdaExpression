Lambda Expression :-

1. Lambda Expression is an anonymous function.
2. It is not having name,modifier and return type.


Example :-

public int getLength(String name){
return name.length;
}

can be written as :- (String name) -> {return name.length;}

Note :- There is only one statement then curly braces are also optional so we can write above statement as

(String name) -> return name.length;

Type reference :-
====================

Some time based on the context compiler can guess the formal parameter type which is known as Type reference.
So we dont need to mention type of the formal parameter like int,float,double,String.

(int a,int b) -> {return (a+b);}
can be written as
(a,b) -> return (a+b);


(String name) -> {return name.length};
can be changed to         //If there is only single line of code then curly braces are optional
(String name) -> return name.length;
can be changed to         //Based on the context compiler can guess the formal parameter type so writing String is also optional.
(name) -> return name.length;
can be changed to         //Based on the context compiler can guess the return type so writing return is also optional.
(name) -> name.length;
can be changed to         //If there is only one formal parameter then brances are also optional
name -> name.length;
